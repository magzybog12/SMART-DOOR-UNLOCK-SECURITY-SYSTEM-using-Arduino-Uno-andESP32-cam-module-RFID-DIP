# SMART-DOOR-UNLOCK-SECURITY-SYSTEM-using C programming, Arduino-Uno-andESP32-cam-module-RFID-DIP
Developing  a home door security system in C with a keypad, RFID scanner, and ESP32-CAM for access control and image capture and implementing user management and monitoring of unauthorized access via a webpage.
This project showcases an advanced IoT-driven security solution that improves standard door locks with automated locking, intruder detection, and real-time monitoring. It uses a numeric keypad, RFID, and remote access for multi-factor authentication. The ESP32 and Arduino Uno run this system. Reliability is ensured via strong encryption, safe communication routes, and fail-safe systems. Its modular architecture sets a new benchmark for access control while enabling seamless interaction with biometrics, cloud-based access management, and smart home systems. It provides scalable and flexible security for both residential and commercial contexts.
